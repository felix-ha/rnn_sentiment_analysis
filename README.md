# rnn_sentiment_analysis


Project of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. The task was to train a recurrent neural network with a LSTM cell with Amazon Sagemaker and deploy it to AWS with an Lambda function and an API.

The dataset can be found [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

In the [notebook](https://github.com/felix-ha/rnn_sentiment_analysis/blob/master/SageMaker%20Project.ipynb) is all code documented and the porject presented.

The final [website](https://github.com/felix-ha/rnn_sentiment_analysis/blob/master/index.html) is not working, because the endpoint is not deployed on AWS anymore.

This project was part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.
